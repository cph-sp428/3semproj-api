## Web App for tracking mountain biking timest on different trails
The main idea for this app is to be able to track all your mountain biking times on different trails.  
You can add new trails, update existing trails and delete trails.  
You can also add new times to trails, update existing times and delete times.  
You can also see all the trails and times in a list.  
It should be limited who can add, update and delete trails and times.  
Users should be split into anyone -> users -> admin.  
Anyone can see all trails and times.  
users can add new times, update and delete their own times.  
Admin can add, update and delete trails and times.
